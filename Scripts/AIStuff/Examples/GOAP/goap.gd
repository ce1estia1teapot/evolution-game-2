# This class is an Autoload accessible globaly.
# It initialises a GoapActionPlanner with the available
# actions.
#
# In your game, you might want to have different planners
# for different enemy/npc types, and even change the set
# of actions in runtime.
#
# This example keeps things simple, creating only one planner
# with pre-defined actions.

Consider attaching a node like this to each NPC type
